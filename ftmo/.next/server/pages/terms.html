class="text-blue-500 font-medium text-lg pb-2">TERMS OF SERVICE</p>As a Forex funding prop firm, FundMeFX does not have a traditional return policy since we provide traders with capital and resources to engage in Forex trading rather than selling physical products. However, we have certain guidelines in place regarding account closures and fund withdrawals, which are outlined below:<br/><p class="text-blue-500 font-medium text-lg pb-2">Account Closure </p>If a trader wishes to close their funded trading account with FundMeFX, they can submit a request to our support team. Account closure requests are subject to review and approval. Once the closure request is processed, the trader&#x27;s access to the trading platform and associated services will be terminated.<p class="text-blue-500 font-medium text-lg pb-2">Fund Withdrawal</p>Traders who have met the specified profit targets and have adhered to the terms and conditions of our funding program are eligible to withdraw funds from their trading accounts. Fund withdrawal requests can be made through the designated process outlined on our platform.<p class="text-blue-500 font-medium text-lg pb-2">2.1 Withdrawal Eligibility </p>To be eligible for fund withdrawals, traders must meet specific criteria, which may include reaching a minimum profit threshold, maintaining compliance with risk management guidelines, and adhering to any other conditions set forth by FundMeFX.<p class="text-blue-500 font-medium text-lg pb-2">2.2 Withdrawal Process </p>Upon submitting a fund withdrawal request, the trader&#x27;s request will be reviewed and processed by our team. The withdrawal process may involve verifying the trader&#x27;s compliance with the funding program rules and regulations. Once approved, funds will be transferred to the trader&#x27;s designated withdrawal method.<p class="text-blue-500 font-medium text-lg pb-2">2.3 Withdrawal Fees </p>FundMeFX may charge withdrawal fees to cover transaction costs associated with fund transfers. These fees, if applicable, will be clearly communicated to traders during the withdrawal request process.<br/>It&#x27;s important to note that specific details regarding account closures, fund withdrawals, and any associated terms and conditions may be subject to individual agreements or policies that are communicated directly to traders upon joining FundMeFX. Traders are encouraged to review and understand these terms and conditions before participating in our funding program.</p><p class="text-black"><br/><p class="text-blue-500 font-medium text-lg pb-2">RIGHT TO WITHDRAW FROM A CONTRACT</p>• If you are a consumer, you have the option to cancel a contract within 14 days of its establishment, without providing a reason (refer to clause 2.10 of the Terms &amp; Conditions for information regarding the timing of contract establishment).
